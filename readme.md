# VR Music
This is a Conceptual prototype of a Music player where people can listen to music from the [Spotify API][api]. There is a public playlist where the guests/users can add and upvote tracks. The main focus is the public music room which is a room where you can immerse yourself in the music in VR.

<!-- This repo will hold the project you're going to build during the last two weeks of RTW. It functions as a way to show you've attained the following learning goals of this course:

- Build a Node Web App which consumes an external data source through an API and serves a frontend using routing and templating techniques.
- Create a "live" web app which reflects changes to the back-end data model in reactive front-end views, using real-time, event-based, messaging technologies like sockets or server-sent-events.
- Describe their work in a professional readme with insightful diagrams showing the life cycle of their data. -->
