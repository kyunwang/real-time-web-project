# real-time-web-project
<!-- This repo will hold the project you're going to build during the last two weeks of RTW. It functions as a way to show you've attained the following learning goals of this course:

* Build a Node Web App which consumes an external data source through an API and serves a frontend using routing and templating techniques.
* Create a "live" web app which reflects changes to the back-end data model in reactive front-end views, using real-time, event-based, messaging technologies like sockets or server-sent-events.
* Describe their work in a professional readme with insightful diagrams showing the life cycle of their data. -->

# Table of Content
- [Getting started](#getting-started)
- [Features](#features)
- [API](#api)

A overview of all links posted in channels in your slack channel which you have joined.

This project will be using the [Slack RTM API][api] and will not work through a slackbot.



<!-- ☝️ replace this description -->

<!-- Add a nice image here at the end of the week, showing off your shiny frontend 📸 -->

# Getting started
The installing information will be placed here

<!-- ...but how does one use this project? What are its features 🤔 -->
# Features
The features will be here

<!-- What external data source is featured in your project and what are its properties 🌠 -->
# API
The API information will be documented here
<!-- rate-limit, authorization method, API methods, etc. -->

This app makes use of the [Slack RTM API][api]

## Limitation
You cannot easily work with this API locally. You will have to use something similar to `ngrok` to be able to develop and test locally. Without `ngrok` you will need to redeploy everytime to test.

There are *Rate limit tiers* from tier 1 to 4 and a special tier.
From tier 1 being 1+ calls per minute, 20+, 50+, 100+ and *varies* respectively.

<!-- Where do the 0️⃣s and 1️⃣s live in your project? What db system are you using?-->

<!-- Maybe a checklist of done stuff and stuff still on your wishlist? ✅ -->

<!-- How about a license here? 📜 (or is it a licence?) 🤷 -->
